🎮 Steam Game Sales Prediction with Machine Learning
Welcome to our college Machine Learning project!
In this project, we predict the number of copies a video game will sell on Steam, based on features like price, genre, rating, and many more.

We built two models:

🔹 Regression Model – Predicts the exact number of copies sold

🔸 Classification Model – Predicts the sales class: Platinum, Gold, Silver, or Bronze

🧠 Project Workflow
🔧 Data Preparation
Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering and selection

Encoding categorical variables and feature scaling

🏗️ Modeling
📈 Regression Models:
Linear Regression

Lasso Regression

Ridge Regression

Ensemble Models (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)

📊 Classification Models:
Logistic Regression

Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and other ensemble methods

✅ Evaluation
Evaluated all models using proper metrics (R², MAE, F1-score, etc.)

Visualization of results and comparison across models

🧪 Test Script Functionality
We created a dedicated test script to evaluate new data on both tasks. The script:

Accepts new game data (manually or via form)

Applies the same preprocessing pipeline (encoding, scaling, feature alignment)

Handles unseen or irrelevant values gracefully

Loads saved models for both regression and classification

Outputs the predicted copies sold and the sales class

🌐 Deployment
Both the regression and classification models are deployed using Streamlit for an interactive, user-friendly experience.
